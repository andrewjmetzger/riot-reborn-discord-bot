# Recover deleted records

## Restore a recently deleted record

If a record was accidentally removed with the [`leave` command](../commands/leave.md), an administrator with Editor access to the spreadsheet can attempt to undo the deletion.

1. From the menu at the top of the window, click **File** &gt; **Version history** &gt; **See version history**

2. In the Version history pane on the right, **select an older revision**, which contains the record you want to restore. Notice the affected records become **highlighted** in the preview to the left.
