# Troubleshoot missing records

## For recently added records

### Refresh the page

If you canâ€™t see recently added data, try to refresh the page. Choose your browser below:

* Google Chrome: At the top left, click **Reload this page**
* Firefox: At the top, click **Reload current page**
* Safari: **View &gt; Reload page**
* Microsoft Edge: On your keyboard, press **F5**

### Disable active filters

By default, filters stay active even after the page is refreshed, which can sometimes hide data from view. Follow these steps to disable filters:

1. With your spreadsheet open, click the **Clan List** sheet tab to make sure it is active.
2. Look at the column and row labels. If these labels are shaded **green** as in the screenshot below, a filter is active.

3. In the editing toolbar, click the **Funnel icon** to disable all active filters on the sheet. Notice the row and column labels are now grey:
