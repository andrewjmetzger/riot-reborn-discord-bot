# Track players capping

## Overview

You can record when a player caps at the clan citadel with the `capped` command. This increases the player's _Times Capped_ by one, and adds the appropriate number of points to the player's total

## Syntax

A typical`capped` command is generally structured as follows:

```text
!track capped "<player_name>" <date>
```

## Arguments

#### player\_name

_Required._ The name of the player that capped. Always surrounded by double quotes.

#### date

_Required._ The date `player_name` capped. Specified in the format `M/D/YYYY`. For instance, if a player capped on 12 March 1969, `date` would be `3/12/1969`.
