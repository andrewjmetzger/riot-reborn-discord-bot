# Track events attended

## Overview {#overview}

You can record when a player hosts a clan event with the `attended` command. This increases the player's _Events Attended_ by one, and adds the appropriate number of points to the player's total.

## Syntax {#syntax}

A typical`attended` command is generally structured as follows:

```text
!track attended "<player_name>" <date>
```

## Arguments {#arguments}

#### player\_name {#player_name}

_Required._ The name of a player who attended the event. Always surrounded by double quotes.

#### date {#date}

_Required._ The date `player_name` attended the event. Specified in the format `M/D/YYYY`. For instance, if the player attended an event on 12 March 1969, `date` would be `3/12/1969`.
